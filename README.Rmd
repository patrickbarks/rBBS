# rBBS

An R package to work with data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey
(BBS).

The BBS is a large-scale bird monitoring program that was initiated in 1966 and
currently encompasses over 4,600 active survey routes in North America. Each
survey involves 50 three-minute point counts conducted at half-mile intervals
along a 24.5-mile route by a skilled volunteer.

The BBS is a cooperative effort between the United States Geological Survey
(USGS) and Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service
(CWS).

See more information at https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/.

See also the terms of use for BBS data at
https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/BBS/RawData/.

## BBS datasets

The BBS provides two main datasets:

*50-stop*

* includes bird counts for each of the 50 stops on a given survey
* only consistently available from 1997 onward

*10-stop*

* bird counts binned into groups of 10 stops (i.e. stops 1-10, 11-20, ..., 41-50)
* consistently available for all survey years


## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("patrickbarks/rBBS")
```


## Usage

#### Download data

To work with BBS data we first need to download it from the USGS ftp server.
This can be done manually following the links at https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/,
or by using the function `bbs_download`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("rBBS")

# "." gives the working directory; you may prefer to specify a different one
bbs_download(dest = ".")
```

The default options download all metadata files and all 10-stop data. The
50-stop data can be downloaded by adding the argument `fifty_stop = TRUE`.

#### Build metadata tables

Metadata tables can be built using the `bbs_meta_*` functions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bcr <- bbs_meta_bcr(bbs_dir = ".")
strata <- bbs_meta_strata(bbs_dir = ".")
regions <- bbs_meta_regions(bbs_dir = ".")
routes <- bbs_meta_routes(bbs_dir = ".")
species <- bbs_meta_species(bbs_dir = ".")
weather <- bbs_meta_weather(bbs_dir = ".")
```

#### Build bird count tables

Tables with bird-count data can be built using the `bbs_build_*` functions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bbs_10 <- bbs_build_10(bbs_dir = ".") # 10-stop data
bbs_50 <- bbs_build_50(bbs_dir = ".") # 50-stop data
```

##### Build in counts of zero

The original BBS data does not include counts of zero (i.e. instances where a
species was not observed on a given route), but these can be built in by setting
`zeros = TRUE` in the `bbs_build_*` functions.

Note that the full dataset _with_ zeros includes more than 92 million rows,
which requires some time to build and a few gigabytes of memory. It's therefore
a good idea to subset to the species, years, or locations of interest within the
call to `bbs_build_*`, e.g.

```{r}
bbs_10 <- bbs_build_10(bbs_dir = ".", zeros = TRUE,
                       states = c('Washington', 'Oregon', 'California'))
```


## Example

Let's say we're interested in the distribution of the Western Meadowlark within
the United States. We can find its American Ornithological Union species code
(aou) in the metadata table `species`.

```{r}
species$aou[species$english_common_name == 'Western Meadowlark']
#> [1] 5011
```

Now we can build a table with the 10-stop count data (including zeros) for the
Western Meadowlark.

```{r}
wm <- bbs_build_10(bbs_dir = ".", zeros = TRUE, countries = 'United States',
                   aou = 5011)
```

Next, we'll summarize the occurrence of the Western Meadowlark by route (unique
combinations of `country_num` x `state_num` x `route`). We'll calculate
occurrence simply as any instance of `species_total > 0` on a given route.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

wm_occur <- wm %>% 
  left_join(regions) %>%  # join regions table to get state names
  subset(state_name != "Alaska") %>%  # remove alaska
  group_by(country_num, state_num, route) %>%  # group by unique routes
  summarize(occur = ifelse(any(species_total > 0), TRUE, FALSE)) %>%  # test for occurrence
  ungroup() %>%  # ungroup
  left_join(routes)  # join routes table to get route coordinates
```

And finally, we'll plot the occurrence data on a map of the United States.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
states <- map_data("state")

ggplot(states) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(long, lat, group = group), fill = 'grey70', col = 'white') +
  geom_point(data = wm_occur, aes(longitude, latitude, col = occur), size = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 'Set1', name = 'Observed')
```
