\title{Function to query 10 or 50 stop data for species, year, and states}
\usage{
GetRouteData(AOU = NULL, countrynum = NULL, states = NULL, year,
  weather = NULL, routes = NULL, Zeroes = TRUE, TenStops = TRUE,
  Dir = "ftp://ftpext.usgs.gov/pub/er/md/laurel/BBS/DataFiles/")
}
\arguments{
\item{AOU}{Vector of species' AOU code}

\item{countrynum}{Vector of country codes, either 124 (Canada), 484 (Mexico),
or 840 (USA).}

\item{states}{Vector of state codes. If they are unique to one country,
countrynum can be NULL.}

\item{year}{Year(s) for which data is wanted: must be after 1997 (pre-1997
data not included yet)}

\item{weather}{Data frame with Weather data. Can be NULL, then function will
extract the data}

\item{routes}{Data frame with routes data. Can be NULL, then function will
extract the data}

\item{Zeroes}{Logical: if TRUE (the default) will return all routes sampled
in relevant years, otherwise only the routes where the species was
observed.}

\item{TenStops}{Logical: if TRUE (the default) get 10-stop data. If false,
get 50-stop data.}

\item{Dir}{Directory to get data. Defaults to
ftp://ftpext.usgs.gov/pub/er/md/laurel/BBS/DataFiles/, the USGS FTP server}
}
\value{
Data frame with the following columns for all data:
  \item{countrynum}{The three digit identification code for country. See
  RegionCodes.txt file for key.}
  \item{statenum}{The two digit numerical code that identifies the state,
  province or territory where the route was run.  See RegionCodes.txt file
  for key.}
  \item{routeID}{character code for route. Should be unique. made of paste
  of state & route IDs}
  \item{route}{The three digit code that identifies the route - unique
  within states.}
  \item{rpid}{Three digit run protocol identification number.  See
  RunProtocolID.txt for key.}
  \item{aou}{The five digit species identification code.}
  \item{Year}{The year}
  \item{Month}{The month}
  \item{Day}{The day}
  \item{RunType}{If this run is acceptable by BBS standards, then this column
  is 1, otherwise it is 0.}
  \item{Latitude}{The latitude of the route start point in decimal degrees.}
  \item{Longitude}{The longitude of the route start point in decimal
  degrees.}
  \item{SumCount}{Total number of individuals of that species counted}

For 10 stop data, these columns in addition:
  \item{count10}{Total individuals of the species recorded on stops 1-10.}
  \item{count20}{Total individuals of the species recorded on stops 11-20.}
  \item{count30}{Total individuals of the species recorded on stops 21-30.}
  \item{count40}{Total individuals of the species recorded on stops 31-40.}
  \item{count50}{Total individuals of the species recorded on stops 41-50.}
  \item{stoptotal}{Total number of stops out of 50 on which the species was
  recorded.}
  \item{speciestotal}{The total number of species recorded on that run of
  the route.}

For 10 stop data, these columns in addition:
  \item{stop1 ... stop50}{Total individuals of the species recorded on that
  stop.}
}
\description{
This function imports the 10 or 50 stop species data from either the USGS BBS
ftp server or another repository
}
\details{
The pre-1997 data from Canada is not included.

## Get data for pileated woodpecker & roadrunner for some states
Data <- GetRouteData(AOU = c(4050, 3850), countrynum = NULL,
                     states = c(89, 40:45), year = 2010, TenStops = TRUE,
                     Zeroes=FALSE)
